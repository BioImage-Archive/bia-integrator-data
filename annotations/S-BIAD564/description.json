  "value": "Image files (raw and processed) underlying the study 'A role for the centrosome in regulating the rate of neuronal efferocytosis by microglia in vivo' by Moller et. al; eLife 2022. The aim of the study was to investigate neuronal efferocytosis, a process where microglia phagocytose apoptotic neurons in the developing brain. By taking a live imaging approach in the transparent zebrafish embryonic brain, they show a central role for microtubules and the centrosome in neuronal efferocytosis. The study finds that while microglia generate multiple microtubule-based branches, they only successfully engulf one apoptotic neuron at a time, and that centrosomal migration into microglial branches is the rate-limiting step in this process. The PLC-DAG signaling pathway is identified as an important mechanism in centrosomal recruitment to the phagocytic cup. Finally, photoswitchable perturbations of microtubules show how microglia are increadibly robust and can switch modes of phagocytosis when lacking dynamic microtubules."
